* The Physics
** Summary of Problem
We are asked to consider a nucleon trapped in a one-dimensional squared well potential of depth $V_0=83MeV$ and $|x| \leq a$ where $a = 2fm$ ($1fm=10^{-15}m$). We then wish to find the wavefunction for this particle and the energy of the quantum states it inhabits.
** Analytical Solution
For our particle, we have the wave function
#+begin_export latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:wave-function}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d^2\Psi}{dx^2} &+ \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\left(E+V_0)\Psi = 0\\
\frac{d^2\Psi}{dx^2} &+ k^2(x)\Psi = 0
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Where $k(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}(E+V_0)}$
Notice that \ref{eq:wave-function} is of the form of a second order differential equation, missing a first order derivative.
